<h1> My Children </h1>

<p style="text-align: center;color:black"> My Eldest Son - He is 17years old. Currently in poly first year - Business Studies.<br>
    He is a full time student athlete at Singapore Sports School as a fencer.<br>
    He started fencing from Primary 2, he loved it and made it his passion in life.<br>
    He attented countless competitions be it local or overseas. The furthest
    he went was Slovakia for a week. <br>Went several European countries, highest record was 3 European and 2 Asian trips in a year.<br>
    Since Covid started, he resigned from National Team and fully concentrating on his studies.<br>
    Still, he is in SSP, training daily and taking up Coach courses when he is free too.<br>
    Not only he is good in fencing, he is a pro in gaming.. Easily getting MVPs ingames.<br> 
    2 younger brothers see him as an idol.<br><br>

</p>

<p> My second son - He is 13years old. Currently, he is also a full time student athelete in SSP.<br>
    Once, we mistook him in taking up fencing just to blindly follow his elder brother.<br>
    Turned out to be he loved the agression and strategies needed to win a fencing game.<br>
    Another gamer in the house. He loved minecraft, roblox also some Shooting Games.<br>
    He can be a real Aquarius, taking pride in things he do. He can be lovable and cheeky at the same time.<br>
    His goal now is to get into National Team by age 15years old and to win his elder brother.<br>

</p>

<p style="text-align: right;color:orange"> My youngest son - He is 9years old. A Primary 3 boy but is incredibily sweet towards me.<br>
    Probably due to being youngest in the family, 2 brothers tend to play on their own when youngest wasn't<br>
    a real good gamer when much younger, so I'm his playmate.<br>
    He loves playing FortNite, can be really good at times, winning battle royale.<br>
    He will be starting his first fencing class in coming Saturday as well. <br>
    Yeah, Im gonna have 3 musketeers in the house pretty soon.<br>
    He is always anxious about me. I can be rather clumsy at home, always hitting my pinky toe.<br>
    Whenever I shout an OUCH, he will come running to me "ARE U OK, MUMMY!?"<br>
    Really a sweet considerate boy.<br>

</p>


<p> My 3 boys can be different in some ways, but they are always so considerate, helpful and loving. <br>
Okay.. Can be rascal at some times.. Im numbed and trained to go blind n deaf at certain moments.<br>
