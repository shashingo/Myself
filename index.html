<h1> What About Myself </h1>
<div>
    <div class="static">
<p> I am a mother of 3 boys. Aged 17yrs, 13yrs and 9years old.<br>
    Yeah, I know I shocked alot of people. I'm not yet 40yrs old.<br> 
    I started working part time from the age of 16yrs old. <br> </p>
    
<p>After "O" lvls, I went DoDo factory to work as a factory girl for 6mths<br>
    before I started my Interior Design course at NAFA. <br>
    I worked as preschool teacher assistant for a year while studying night classes.<br>
    By age 17.5yrs, I worked full time at Nielsen Survey Company (used to be ACNielsen) <br>
    as a coder for 5yrs. Yeap. I gave up my Interior Design course as i was <br> 
    once rebellious. Always clubbing, partying and having fun. </p> <br>

  <p>I was with my husband since 16.5yrs old. We got married when I was 20yrs old.<br>
    Nope.. It wasn't a shotgun marriage. *giggles*. <br>
    I had my first boy when I was 21yrs old. I resigned when my first boy was 2yrs old.<br>
    To date, I have never stopped working while being a full time housewife for 15yrs. <br>

<p>
    Having children and being housewife at a young age do have the advantages.<br>
    My boys and I are like best friends. We have common interests - playing games,<br>
    and sports. We are officially gamers.. From Playstation, PC mmorpg to <br>
    mobile games like MLBB and latest Pokemon Unite.

<p> Lastly, I'm back to study cos my boys are so much older and independant<br>
    It is time for mummy to have some "me" time!"
